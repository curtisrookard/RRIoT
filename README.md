# RRIoT Overview
Repository for "RRIoT: Recurrent Reinforcement Learning for Cyber Threat Detection on IoT Devices" currently under review. 

This repository hosts code associated for the RRIoT model from the manuscript titled "RRIoT: Recurrent Reinforcment Learning for Cyber Threat Detection on IoT Devices." The code from this repository is adapted from the code found in this repository: https://github.com/gcamfer/Anomaly-ReactionRL. Major contributions compared to the previous repository include:
1) Applying the models on IoT telemetry data 
2) Incorporating the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient model as part of the RIoT model
3) Applying SAGE to determine global feature importance
